            <p>This website is a project meant to showcase
            my ability to code a functional website using html and css. My topic for this website
            is a space for my sister, Briar Rose Krause, to showcase her digital art, and 
            to take commissions for new art.<br />
            All of the requirements that have been implemented in version 1 of my website are as follows:<br />
            <ol style="line-height: 2em;">
                <li>M1LO6 Demonstrate the use of basic HTML tags to create a simple Web page (HTML, this item should be specified once, describing how the file it is in meets this outcome)</li>
                <li>M1LO7 Demonstrate the use of ordered lists (HTML)</li>
                <li>M1LO8 Demonstrate the use of external style sheets (HTML, note the external style sheet must exist and contain CSS)</li>
                <li>M1LO9 Demonstrate the use of inline images (HTML)</li>
                <li>M1LO10 Demonstrate the use of special characters from extended character sets (HTML, use entities, not cut-and-pasted unicode characters)</li>
                <li>M1LO12 Create navigation using unordered lists (HTML)</li>
                <li>M1LO13 Demonstrate using 3 types of hyperlinks: site navigation, targeted location using ids, and external (HTML, this item should be specified 3 times, once on each type of link)</li>
                <li>M2LO3 Demonstrate style precedence and inheritance in CSS (CSS, this item should be specified 2 times, once where precedence is applied and once where inheritance is applied; see 2-3d Style Specificity and Precedence, and 2-3e Style Inheritance)</li>
                <li>M2LO4 Demonstrate external, embedded, and inline styles (HTML, this item should be specified 2 times, once each for embedded and inline styles; note external was taken care of with M1LO8; see 2-3b Embedded Style Sheets, and 2-3c Inline Styles)</li>
                <li>M2LO5 Demonstrate contextual selectors (CSS, specify 2 times, showing two different types of contextual selectors as shown in Figure 2-12, Contextual Selectors, of the textbook)</li>
                <li>M2LO6  Demonstrate a CSS id and a CSS class selector (CSS, specify 2 times, show a use of id and a use of class, see 2-9b Attribute selectors)</li>
                <li>M2LO7 Demonstrate a CSS attribute selector other than class or id (CSS, specify 1 time, see 2-9b Attribute selectors)</li>
                <li>M2LO11 Demonstrate a pseudo-classes and a pseudo-element selector (CSS, specify 2 times, show one pseudo-class and one pseudo-element, see 2-18 Using Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements)</li>
                <li>M2LO12 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of page elements (CSS, these are styles that impact page elements rather than impacting text on the page)</li>
                <li>M2LO13 Demonstrate how CSS can change presentation of textual elements (CSS, these are styles that impact text that is rendered on the page)</li>
                <li>M2LO14 Demonstrate and explain the use of progressive enhancement in CSS (CSS, see 2-6 Employing Progressive Enhancement)</li>
                <li>M2LO15 Apply colors using CSS (CSS, see 2-5 Working with Color in CSS)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The web pages the Homepage, About Project: V1, Gallery, and About are where the html requirements are implemented. The respective
            html files are index.html, about.html, gallery/gallery.html, and aboutbriar.html. 
            the web pages have not been fleshed out yet, as well as Contact and Commissions are mostly empty.
            The CSS requirements are in the file styles.css.<br />
            Right now this website is limited in its capabilities. Right now my website implements virtually everything
            we have covered in the class. It was enough to get my website presentable and partially functional
            as an early build.
