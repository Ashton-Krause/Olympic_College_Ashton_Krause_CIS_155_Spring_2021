            <p>This website is a project meant to showcase
            my ability to code a functional website using html and css. My topic for this website
            is a space for my sister, Briar Rose Krause, to showcase her digital art, and 
            to take commissions for new art.<br />
            All of the requirements that have been implemented in version 1 of my website are as follows (hover to expand):<br />
            <!--M6LO3 Demonstrate how to create a table (HTML, explain table's purpose; it needs to be appropriate data for a table, and have at least 2 columns and 3 rows, appropriate use of thead/tbody/tfooter, and cells using th/td appropriately)-->
            <!--this will make the list of learning objectives easier to read and to prevent it from becoming a wall of text when there are a lot of objectives in a single version-->

            <p>The web pages the Homepage, About Project: V1, Gallery, and About are where the html requirements are implemented. The respective
            html files are index.html, about.html, gallery/gallery.html, and aboutbriar.html. 
            the web pages have not been fleshed out yet, as well as Contact and Commissions are mostly empty.
            The CSS requirements are in the file styles.css.<br />
            Right now this website is limited in its capabilities. Right now my website implements virtually everything
            we have covered in the class. It was enough to get my website presentable and partially functional
            as an early build.
